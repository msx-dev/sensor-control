# Real-time Sensor Measure & Control App by max

## Hi!

This is a project for real-time monitoring of sensor status and measuring data.

It was created with React on FE and Express.js on BE.
Since we need real-time data, WebSockets were used on BE and no DB.

## Note about data & notes

Data is random generated so don't pay too much attention to rapidly changing values :)

Notes are currently not saved anywhere. You will lose all the data you write there.
